## Installation

1. Install requirements with the following command :

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   Upgrade all required with the following command:
   `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

2. Make sure you have Chrome installed

3. (Windows Only) Make sure Visual C++ redistributable DLLs are installed

   If they're not, install the current "vc_redist.exe" from
   this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
   and reboot your computer

4. Edit the `.template-config-private.yaml` accordingly and rename it to `config-private.yaml`.

5. Edit the `accounts.json.sample` with your accounts credentials and rename it by removing
   `.sample` at the end.

   The "totp" field is not mandatory, only enter your TOTP key if you use it for 2FA (if
   ommitting, don't keep it as an empty string, remove the line completely).

   The "proxy" field is not mandatory, you can omit it if you don't want to use proxy (don't
   keep it as an empty string, remove the line completely).

     - If you want to add more than one account, the syntax is the following:

   ```json
   [
    {
        "username": "Your Email 1",
        "password": "Your Password 1",
        "totp": "0123 4567 89ab cdef",
        "proxy": "http://user:pass@host1:port"
    },
    {
        "username": "Your Email 2",
        "password": "Your Password 2",
        "totp": "0123 4567 89ab cdef",
        "proxy": "http://user:pass@host2:port"
    }
   ]
   ```

6. Run the script:

   `python main.py`

7. (Windows Only) You can set up automatic execution by generating a Task Scheduler XML file.

   If you are a Windows user, run the `generate_task_xml.py` script to create a `.xml` file.
   After generating the file, import it into Task Scheduler to schedule automatic execution of
   the script. This will allow the script to run at the specified time without manual
   intervention.

   To import the XML file into Task Scheduler,
   see [this guide](https://superuser.com/a/485565/709704).
