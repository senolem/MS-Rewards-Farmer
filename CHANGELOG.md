All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2024-08-30

### Added

- Promotions/More activities
  - Expand your vocabulary
  - What time is it?

## [1.0.1] - 2024-08-25

### Fixed

- [AssertionError from apprise.notify(title=str(title), body=str(body))](https://github.com/klept0/MS-Rewards-Farmer/issues)

## [1.0.0] - 2024-08-23

### Removed

- `apprise.urls` from [config.yaml](config.yaml)
  - This now lives in `config-private.yaml`, see [.template-config-private.yaml](.template-config-private.yaml) on how
    to configure
  - This prevents accidentally leaking sensitive information since `config-private.yaml` is .gitignore'd

### Added

- Support for automatic handling of logins with 2FA and for passwordless setups:
  - Passwordless login is supported in both visible and headless mode by displaying the code that the user has to select
    on their phone in the terminal window
  - 2FA login with TOTPs is supported in both visible and headless mode by allowing the user to provide their TOTP key
    in `accounts.json` which automatically generates the one time password
  - 2FA login with device-based authentication is supported in theory, BUT doesn't currently work as the undetected
    chromedriver for some reason does not receive the confirmation signal after the user approves the login
- Completing quizzes started but not completed in previous runs
- Promotions/More activities
  - Find places to stay
  - How's the economy?
  - Who won?
  - Gaming time

### Changed

  - How incomplete promotions are determined
  - Batched into single versus multiple notifications
- Full exception is sent via Apprise versus just error message
